     * SomeConcreteClass is not public. We then recurse over all interfaces implemented by

     * There is a built-in assumption that the method will never return null (or, equivalently, that
     * it returns the primitive data type, i.e. `long` rather than `Long`). If this
     * assumption doesn't hold, the method might be called repeatedly and the returned value will be
     * the one produced by the last call.
